# Scientific_Calculator_In_Typescript
This is a web-based scientific calculator application built using HTML, CSS, and TypeScript. The calculator is designed to perform complex mathematical operations beyond basic arithmetic. In this Project There are three Classes

    - Calculator: this class represent Calculator
    - InputDisplay: this class represent Display that takes Input
    - Memory: this class represent all Memory Functions 

## Features
- Basic arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division
- Trigonometric functions: sin, cos, tan, cot, sec, cosec
- Logarithmic functions: log base 2, log base 10 and natural log 
- Constants: pi and e
- Parentheses for grouping operations
- Degree/radian modes for trigonometric functions

## How to Use
- Download the files and save them on your device.
- Open the index.html file in your web browser.
- Input the desired mathematical expression using the calculator buttons.
- Press the "=" button to calculate the result.
- If you need to perform another calculation, press "C" to clear the display and start again.

## Modes
### Degree/Radian Mode
- The calculator allows you to switch between degree and radian modes. To change modes, follow these steps:
- Click on "DEG" or "RAD" button it will toggle.

## Limitations
- The calculator may encounter errors if you input an incorrect mathematical expression 
- The calculator does not support imaginary numbers or complex numbers.
- The calculator may display a result in scientific notation for large or small numbers.
